In this folder you find the set of programs used to set up the QM/EE calculations on eT for the set of molecules guiven as input.

In particular you find:

 -initial_geometries/ : the folder containing the .xyz of the molecules of the DES you want to parameterize. 
                        WARNING: the second line of these .xyz contains the keyword CHARGE: (+-) 1.0.
                        !!!!!!!  This keyword is mandatory, and accounts for the charge of the molecule in an automatic fashion 
                        !!!!!!!  when you set up the eT calculation.

 -make_dipoles.py     : this program takes the input .xyz geometries of the DES molecules and generates the initial dipoles .dip and .xyz files in seed_dipoles/ directory.
                        Read the program to have more detailed information

 -seed_dipoles/       : the seed dipoles have the center of mass placed at 1 Angstrom from the atom of the DES from which are generated and sign '+-'.
                        These are generated from the make_dipoles.py.
                        The .xyz are used for visualizing the generated dipoles. 
                        WARNING: these seed diples are used in the next codes. If you want to change something about the dipoles, you should always work on the
                        !!!!!!!  .dip files, which contain information about position, direction, and sign of the dipoles. 
                        !!!!!!!  The .xyz are just for visualization

 -traslate_dipoles.py : this program takes the seed .dip files and for each molecule, it traslates each dipole of a certain amount.
                        The new .dip files are saved in the traslated_dipoles/DES_molecule/ folder (where DES_molecule changes depending on the molecule)
                        Optionally in  traslated_dipoles/DES_molecule/xyz also the .xyz are saved for visualization purposes.

 -traslated_dipoles/  : folder containing folders named according to the different DES molecules. Each of these subfolders contains the .dip files 
                        generated by traslate_dipoles.py

 -make_et_inputs.py   : this program generates for each DES molecule, each dipole and each distance of this dipole from the QM DES molecule, the 
                        right eT.inp file. These are generated in eT_inputs/DES_molecule/ folder (where DES_molecule changes depending on the molecule)
                        These files are generated starting from the template seed.inp file. (see later)

 -eT_inputs/          : folder containing folders named according to the different DES molecules. Each of these subfolders contains the .inp files
                        generated by make_et_inputs.py.

 -seed.inp            : template eT input file used for all the computations. Name, charge and geometry will be assigned by make_et_inputs.
                        All the other information about the computation (which are shared among all the DES QM/EE calculations) need to be set by the user.
